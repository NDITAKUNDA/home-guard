# Usage
So this project is comprised of 2 parts the RESTful API and WEB APP.
### RESTful API
The api provides the communication between the database and endpoints to data that is needed. The api has three main endpoints which are "/api/services",
"/api/devices" and "/api/notification". The functionaluty of the api's is better explained in the files where the code is.
### WEB APP
The web app simply works off the api's with it only serving as an interface between the user and the system.
